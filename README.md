*Joint Inference of Demography and Recent Positive Selection*.

Content
-------
It contains 2 simulations studies and one data analysis:

* [simulation_study_mcsf](https://github.com/statgenlmu/paper-coestimation/tree/master/simulation_study_mcsf): Code for the simulation study to determine the power of MCSF
* [simulation_study_coestimation](https://github.com/statgenlmu/paper-coestimation/tree/master/simulation_study_coestimation): Code for the simulation study to evaluate the importance of coestimation and performance of the approach
* [analysis_drosophila](https://github.com/statgenlmu/paper-coestimation/tree/master/analysis_drosophila): Code for the *Drosophila Melanogaster* application example 


Requirements
------------
* The analysis require a recent version (>= 3.1) of [R](https://www.r-project.org/).
