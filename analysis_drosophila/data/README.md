Raw Data
========

I got the data used here from Stephan Hutter. It resides on the internal server
of the evolutionary genetics group in Munich.


Data Format
-----------
Each line of a file contains a single segregating site. The lines are divided up
into 5 fields, separated by tabs:
1) Chromosome
2) Position
3) Vector of D. melanogaster alleles
4) D. simulans and D. sechellia outgroup states
5) Vector of annotation codes

The vector of annotations contains each (reasonably) interesting GFF feature.
Each feature is represented by a single letter. Some additional annotations
(codon positions, intron sizes, positions within introns)
were calculated and are represented by numbers or special characters. Find them
here.
The annotations are based on Flybase Release v5.57, which is the final
annotation for Release 5.
